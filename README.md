# AI ASSISTANT WRAPPER

## Description
A modular, containerized platform designed to provide a branded, secure, and multi-tenant wrapper for LLM services. The architecture enables businesses to deploy proprietary AI agents with integrated subscription billing and usage management, ensuring data isolation and enterprise-grade security.

## Infrastructure & Environment
- **Target OS:** Linux-based distributions (optimized for AlmaLinux, Ubuntu, or Debian).
- **Resource Footprint:** Efficiently optimized for 2 vCPUs and 2GB RAM; deployment-ready via containerized environments.
- **Security Architecture:**
  - Encrypted storage volumes via LUKS.
  - Multi-tenant architecture enforced by Postgres Row-Level Security (RLS), ensuring strict logical isolation of proprietary agent training data.
  - Web serving and automated TLS via Caddy.


## Technology Stack
### Backend
- **Framework:** Python, FastAPI, and Uvicorn.
- **Data Management:** PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities and SQLAlchemy ORM.
- **Integration Layer:** LiteLLM for unified LLM provider abstraction (Anthropic/OpenAI) and Stripe SDK for subscription lifecycle management.
- **Security Utilities:** Native bcrypt for secure credential handling.

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React and Vite, focused on a modular, personalized interface.

### Core Features
- **Multi-Tenancy:** Hardened tenant isolation via RLS policies, preventing cross-tenant data leakage at the database kernel level.
- **Usage Tracking:** Token-based consumption monitoring to support scalable monthly subscription models.
- **Deployment:** Container-first architecture using Podman for reproducible development and production parity.


**Development Methodology:** This project utilizes AI-assisted coding to accelerate implementation and ensure robust, production-grade standards through iterative, human-vetted engineering.

**LEGAL NOTICE:** The platform core (backend and frontend) is distributed under the BSD-3-Clause License. All agent-specific training data and proprietary RAG assets remain strictly confidential and the **exclusive property** of the end-user/tenant.
